// A league's own `--evaluate` is deliberately coarse: a rating costs bouts the fit could have had,
// so a night at `--evaluate 25` leaves two or three points and no curve. The pool files hold the
// weights of every snapshot the run ever took, so the curve can be bought afterwards at whatever
// the morning can afford, on a machine that is no longer training. That is the whole of this
// script: read the snapshots, rate each one exactly the way the run would have, print a row.
//
// **The rating is the run's own instrument and not a second one.** `ratePolicy` from
// `scripts/train-ppo.mjs` is called with the arm's evaluation pool -- `seed ^ 0xc0f1c0f1`, the same
// derivation `scripts/league.mjs` uses -- so a row printed here is comparable to the rows the run
// printed itself, and to the other arms, and to nothing else. Ratings taken on a different pool
// are a different instrument however similar they look.
//
// The last row is `main`, the live weights out of `league.json` rather than a pool file. On an arm
// that snapshotted on its last iteration those two are the same weights and the row is a repeat;
// on any other arm it is the only rating of where the run actually got to.
