# Design rules

Short document, load-bearing content. These are the constraints that make the
project's central claim — *the same inputs produce the same run, everywhere,
forever* — true rather than aspirational.

## The determinism contract

Given the same `Scenario`, the same seed and the same sequence of submitted
actions, `World` produces byte-identical state on every target, in every build
profile, on every thread. `World::state_hash()` is how you check.

What that requires, concretely:

**No floating point reaches simulation state.** `Fx::to_f32` exists for the
renderer and for printing. If a value crosses back into the world from an `f32`,
the contract is void. The bit-exact IEEE operations (`+ - * /`, `sqrt`) would
technically be safe; the temptation they create is not, so the rule is absolute
rather than nuanced.

**No transcendental functions.** `sin`/`cos` come from a 1024-entry table
committed as Rust source (`crates/fx/src/sin_table.rs`). `atan2` is a
polynomial approximation in fixed point, accurate to about 0.09°. Both are
identical everywhere by construction. A build-time computation would have baked
in the *building* host's libm, which defeats the purpose.

**Arithmetic saturates.** Not wraps, not panics. Wrapping arithmetic panics in
debug and wraps in release, which means a debug build and a release build
compute different histories — a class of bug that only shows up when you compare
a dev run against CI. Saturation is one behaviour in all profiles. It is still a
bug when it happens; it just fails visibly instead of silently.

**No RNG state in the world.** Randomness (currently only perception noise)
comes from `Rng::from_stream(seed, tick, entity)`. A draw depends on *what* is
being decided, never on the order entities are visited, so iteration order can
change freely without changing results. There is no global or thread-local RNG
anywhere in the project.

**Fixed iteration order, index tie-breaks.** Every loop runs in ascending entity
index. Every "nearest" or "best" comparison breaks ties on index. Sorting uses
stable sorts with explicit tie-breakers.

**Deaths resolve after all attacks.** Two units that kill each other on the same
tick both die. Applying deaths during the attack loop would make the outcome
depend on entity index, which quietly makes mirror matches unfair.

**No wall clock, no threads, no I/O in `sim`.** The crate cannot observe
anything that varies between runs. `crates/sim/tests/determinism.rs` runs the
same scenario on eight threads and asserts one answer.

### What is *not* covered

Policies. A neural policy is explicitly allowed to be unportable — that is why
replays record actions rather than seeds (see below). Cross-platform equality is
required of `World`, not of whatever decided the actions.

## The agent boundary

`Observation` in, `Action` out. That is the entire interface.

The observation is not a view of the world; it is *what perception allows*. The
world holds ground truth, and `World::observe` degrades it by the observer's
stats before handing it over. A policy cannot reach past it, which is what makes
`perception` a meaningful stat instead of a damage multiplier.

`Observation::write_features` flattens to a fixed-width vector for a future
network. Nothing uses it yet. It exists now because the *layout* is the contract
a trained network gets frozen against, and changing it later means retraining.

Actions persist until the agent's next decision tick. A slow-witted character
keeps executing a stale plan; a sharp one re-plans up to sixty times a second.
That is the whole of "intellect makes you faster".

## Replays

`Replay` stores agent decisions as `(tick, entity, action)` and player orders as
`(tick, faction, order)`. Not a seed.

Both halves matter. The first version recorded only agent actions, and every
replay diverged — the entities were all in exactly the right places, but the
standing orders were missing, and orders are part of world state. A replay that
records half the inputs reproduces half the run. Anything that can change the
world from outside belongs in the log.

Recording the seed and re-running policies is smaller and simpler, and it breaks
the moment a policy is a neural network: a wasm SIMD matmul and a native AVX
matmul reduce in different orders, so logits differ in the last bit, an `argmax`
flips on a near-tie, and the whole run diverges. Recording decisions means
playback never runs inference — the sim is fed exactly what it was fed the first
time.

Cost: roughly 180 records/second at thirty agents, a few hundred KB for a long
fight before compression. Worth it.

`lab verify` is the standing check: it runs a batch, re-runs each fight, and
replays each fight, requiring all three to agree bit for bit. 200/200 at the
time of writing.

## Deliberate non-choices

**No ECS.** Structure-of-arrays over a generational free list. At the entity
counts this genre needs — dozens, not tens of thousands — an archetype engine
buys nothing and costs the two properties that matter most: trivially hashable
state, and a tick loop that reads top to bottom.

**No spatial partitioning.** Collision separation is O(n²). At fifty entities a
spatial hash is slower and much easier to get subtly wrong. Revisit when a
scenario actually needs hundreds — and when it does, the hash must produce
results identical to the brute-force version, which is a test worth writing
first.

**No dependencies.** Not even `rand` or `rayon`. A generator that "improves" in
a point release invalidates every recorded run in the repository. `std::thread::scope`
covers the parallelism this needs.

**No renderer yet.** It is the easiest piece and the one that would have shaped
everything else if it came first.

## Performance notes

`Vec2::length` is the hot path and runs a bit-by-bit `isqrt64` (~32 iterations).
That is fine at current entity counts. The obvious optimisation later is that
`f64::sqrt` is exactly specified by IEEE-754 and therefore *is* portable, so a
float square root with an integer correction step would be both fast and
deterministic — the one place a float could be admitted without breaking the
contract. Measure before doing it.

`[profile.dev] opt-level = 1` is set because a test here is thousands of
simulated ticks. Unoptimised fixed-point math makes `cargo test` slow enough
that people stop running it.

## Rules that exist for termination, not for flavour

Two rules earn their place by stopping fights from failing to end. Both were
added after measuring, not by guessing.

**Out-of-combat regeneration** (`REGEN_PER_TICK`, three seconds after the last
blow, full heal in thirty). Without it, an agent whose health drops below its
caution threshold can never come back: it flees, loses sight, marches back under
its standing order, flees again, forever. That was 12% of all runs, with mean
surviving health of 0.20 — not two sides failing to find each other, but two
sides of walking wounded. Regeneration turns retreating into a real tactic
(withdraw, recover, return). Draws fell to 3%, and mean fight length from 1330
ticks to 921.

**The wall sweep** in `UtilityPolicy::march`. An agent ordered to advance that
has reached the far wall used to grind into it. It now sweeps along the wall
toward whichever side has more room, which turns a stall into a patrol.

The general lesson: a fight that cannot end is worse than a fight that ends
badly. A draw scores zero, tells evolution nothing, and costs a full tick limit
of compute — the most expensive possible way to learn nothing.

## Open questions

**Search behaviour.** The wall sweep is not search — agents still have no memory
of where they have looked. Skirmish spawns are confined to a vertical band
because across the full arena the two sides can walk past each other. Papered
over, not solved.

**Self-play.** Evolution currently scores candidates against a fixed hand-tuned
opponent, which measures "better than what we wrote by hand". Self-play measures
something more interesting and introduces the usual instabilities.

**Fitness shaping.** The current function rewards winning, then surviving
health, then damage, with a small time penalty. The time penalty is load
bearing: without it, "run away and survive to the tick limit" outscores
"attack and sometimes die", and evolution will find that out long before you do.
